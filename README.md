## Buisness Card

This is a simple application that could use a fair amount of work so that it takes user input to create their own personalized profile, but creating this application taught me how to not rely on Main.storyboard since it was my first application that was done 100% programmatically teaching me how to visualize how the application would look in my head before I could actually run an see.
